// JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.
// ES Modules rely on the import and export statements.

// You can export a function or variable from any file.
// There are two types of exports: Named and Default.
// Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export.

export const name = "Abhi";
export const age = 40;

// It is also similar as 
// const name = "Abhi";
// const age = 40;
// export {name,age};

// Default Exports
// You can only have one default export in a file.
// refer to message.js
